# CTAO Science Data Challenge: GW–GRB Tiling Simulation 🔭🌌

This repository contains code to run **tiling simulations for the CTAO Science Data Challenge**, aimed at producing **IACT observations** of a **mock gravitational-wave (GW) event** from a **binary neutron star (BNS) merger** with an associated **gamma-ray burst (GRB) emission** 🚀💥.

The pipeline simulates CTAO follow-up observations by generating observation tiles over the GW localization region, enabling realistic scheduling and coverage studies for IACT observations in the context of **multi-messenger astrophysics** 🌍✨.

The code uses **`tilepy`** as a baseline framework and extends it to support the specific requirements of the CTAO Science Data Challenge 🧩🛠️.
